#summary Milestones and tasks for the GLSL Back End.

= First Milestone =

Achieve the following functionality

  * 1.3 desktop shaders
  * the amount of 1.0 (ES) shader functionality that comes with that

But not yet able to do

  * Loops
  * Function calls
  * Vertex shaders
  * outputs other than gl_FragColor
  * matrices (uncommon in fragment shaders)

= Things to do (who's currently working on it) in priority order =

  * Correct location of declarations for split control flow (JohnK, finished)
  * Have regression tests generating both Mesa IR and GLSL outputs (Michael)
  * Finish generating Top IR texturing calls (Cody)
  * Reconstruct texturing calls (Cody)
  * Correct symbol names for external linkage (JohnK, finished)
  * Handle bool types in bottom (JohnK, finished)
  * Install an exception handling model so we can wrap failed runs and report the right error to the user. (Michael)
  * Check all existing asserts and unsupported prints for correct usage in the exception model. (John)
  * Ensuring all unsupported functionality has an exception raised
  * Reduce output to just the shader (Michael)
  * Top IR constructors, for simple common cases
  * Top IR L-value swizzling
  * Top IR arrays for uniforms, inputs
  * GLSL back end L-value swizzling
  * GLSL back end arrays for uniforms, inputs
  * Handle the (non-texturing) built-in functions
  * Run-time tests for what mode it's in; simple, obfuscating, or optimizing (Michael)
  * Identify flow control we can't handle (Michael)
  * Run-time #version control of features
  * Have a better switch than gla::UseTgsiBackend for controlling what backend is used (Michael)
  * Figure out how to keep matrices through the stack (JohnK)
